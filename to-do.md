# Satsfi MVP: Project Status & To-Do List

## Project Summary

*   **Overall Completion:** ~60%
*   **Backend:** 75% (Core API, intent parsing, and database connection are complete. Needs contract integration.)
*   **Smart Contracts:** 50% (Contracts are written but lack tests and have not been deployed.)
*   **Frontend:** 60% (UI is built, Civic auth and Wallet connection are working. Data display is partial.)

---

## Remaining MVP Tasks

### High-Priority / Next Up:
1.  **Deploy Contracts:** Deploy the Solidity contracts to a public testnet (e.g., Core Testnet).
2.  **Connect Backend to Contracts:** Replace mock logic in the backend with real `ethers.js` calls to the deployed smart contracts.
3.  **Make Dashboard Live:** Connect the main dashboard metrics and cards (`PositionCard`, `MarketOverview`, etc.) to display live data from the backend.
4.  **Implement Transaction Signing:** When a user's intent is processed, use the connected wallet to sign and send the actual transaction.

## Phase 1-3: Foundation (✅ Complete)

*   [✅] **Phase 1: Backend Setup & Core Services**
*   [✅] **Phase 2: Smart Contract Authoring**
*   [✅] **Phase 3: Frontend Foundation & Authentication**

---

## Phase 4: Backend Integration (✅ Complete)

*   [✅] **4.1. Connect to Database:** Established connection to MongoDB.
*   [✅] **4.2. Create Data Models:** Created the `Transaction` model.
*   [✅] **4.3. Build Data Endpoints:** Created the `GET /transactions` endpoint.
*   [✅] **4.4. Enhance Intent Routing:** Intent controller now saves transactions to the database.

## Phase 5: Frontend Web3 & Data Integration (Current Phase)

This phase makes the frontend fully interactive and connected to on-chain actions and backend data.

*   [✅] **5.1. Integrate Web3 Wallet:**
    *   [✅] Added `wagmi` to the frontend.
    *   [✅] Added a "Connect Wallet" button to the Navbar.
    *   [✅] Users can successfully connect a MetaMask wallet.
*   [✅] **5.2. Connect History Page to Live Data:** The `/history` page now fetches and displays real transaction data from the backend.
*   [ ] **5.3. Connect Dashboard to Live Data**
    *   [ ] Fetch and display real-time user portfolio data (balances, staked amounts, debt) from new backend endpoints.
    *   [ ] Make the metrics in `PositionCard`, `MarketOverview`, and the main dashboard summary functional.
*   [ ] **5.4. Implement Transaction Signing**
    *   [ ] When a user's intent is processed, pop up a transaction modal for them to confirm and sign the on-chain action with their connected wallet.

## Phase 6: Smart Contract Deployment & Integration

This phase will take the completed contracts and bring them online, connecting them to our application.

*   [ ] **6.1. Test and Deploy**
    *   [ ] Write comprehensive tests for all smart contracts. (Previously skipped, now required).
    *   [ ] Write and execute deployment scripts for all contracts to the Core TestNet.
    *   [ ] Store final contract addresses and ABIs securely.
*   [ ] **6.2. Connect Backend to Smart Contracts**
    *   [ ] Install `ethers.js` in the backend.
    *   [ ] Replace mock logic in `stakingController.js` and `lendingController.js` with actual Web3 calls to the deployed contracts.
    *   [ ] Implement robust error handling for failed transactions.

## Phase 7: Finalization

*   [ ] **Full-Stack Testing:** Conduct end-to-end testing of the primary user flows (Sign-in -> Connect Wallet -> Enter Intent -> Sign Transaction -> View Updated Dashboard).
*   [ ] **Styling and Polish:** Finalize UI/UX details.
*   [ ] **Deployment:** Prepare both backend and frontend for a production environment.
