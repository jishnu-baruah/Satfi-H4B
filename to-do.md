# Satsfi MVP: Project Status & To-Do List

## Project Summary

*   **Overall Completion:** ~85%
*   **Backend:** 90% (Core API, intent parsing, user management, and database integration are complete. Ready for deeper contract logic.)
*   **Smart Contracts:** 75% (Contracts are written and deployed, but backend interaction is mocked.)
*   **Frontend:** 90% (UI is built, authentication is stable, and pages display live data from the backend.)

## Phase 7: Finalization & Future Work (Current Phase)

This phase focuses on replacing mock logic with real contract interactions and refining the application.

### High-Priority / Next Up:
1.  **Connect Backend to Live Contracts:**
    *   [ ] Install and configure `ethers.js` in the backend.
    *   [ ] Replace mock success messages in `stakingController.js` and `lendingController.js` with real Web3 calls to the deployed smart contracts.
    *   [ ] This involves creating, signing, and sending transactions on behalf of the user or preparing transactions for the user to sign on the frontend.
2.  **Make Dashboard Fully Live:**
    *   [ ] Create backend endpoints to fetch real user portfolio data from the smart contracts (e.g., total staked value, current debt, rewards).
    *   [ ] Connect the dashboard metrics (`PositionCard`, `MarketOverview`, etc.) to these new endpoints.
3.  **Implement Frontend Transaction Signing:**
    *   [ ] When a user's intent requires an on-chain action, the frontend should receive the transaction data from the backend.
    *   [ ] A modal should appear prompting the user to confirm and sign the transaction using their connected `wagmi` wallet.
4.  **Full-Stack Testing:**
    *   [ ] Conduct end-to-end testing of the primary user flow: Sign-in -> Connect Wallet -> Enter Intent -> Sign Transaction -> View Updated Dashboard & History.

### Low-Priority / Future Ideas:
*   [ ] **Refine AI Recommendations:** Improve the "AI Recommendations" feed on the dashboard with more dynamic and intelligent suggestions.
*   [ ] **Expand Protocol Support:** Integrate with other DeFi protocols to offer more complex and rewarding strategies.
*   [ ] **UI/UX Polish:** Conduct a final review of the user interface for consistency and ease of use.
*   [ ] **Add User Settings:** Make the `/settings` page functional, allowing users to manage their profile or notification preferences.
